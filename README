== Prerequisites ==

Before proceeding, make sure you have the latest versions of
yasnippet[1] and js2-mode[2] installed and configured.

1. http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/
2. http://code.google.com/p/js2-mode/

== Configuration ==

Clone the snippets repository, and add the following to ~/.emacs:

(let ((closure-snippets "~/dev/closure-snippets/emacs"))
  (add-to-list 'load-path closure-snippets)
  (require 'closure-snippets-support)
  (yas/load-directory closure-snippets))

Closure Snippets uses prompt functions, which you wil probably want to
configure if you haven't already, as the default (yas/x-prompt) is not
very usable. I suggest the following configuration:

(setq yas/prompt-functions '(yas/ido-prompt yas/dropdown-prompt yas/completing-prompt yas/x-prompt yas/no-prompt))
